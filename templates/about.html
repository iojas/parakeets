					<h2 class="green-title"><span class="fa"></span> About Parakeets</h2>
					<p>After extensive research, it has been overwhelmingly proven that maximum learning of a child happens during the early years of a child’s life. The years 3 to 6 are for shaping the neurological structure of the brain, when the mind is open to the new ideas, imagining, exploring and creating. It is the foundation where the child is grown and sharpens in all skills of his life, normally the skills which are taught in the domain of parenting, and passed on to the child’s teachers.  It is development of the physical, intellectual, emotional, linguistic, social and moral skills of a child, so that the child stands well prepared for his beautiful life ahead! 
At Parakeets, we have a young, dynamic and experienced staff that understand the sensitivity of the time, therefore make sure to turn these delicate buds into the beautiful blossoming flower with their dedication and hard-work! 

					<p>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

					<h2 class="green-title"><span class="fa"></span> World of Parakeets</h2>
					<p>For a child, Parakeets is a ‘Home away from Home’. We at Parakeets make sure that the child feels very much comfortable there. We have the spacious, well- ventilated classrooms, where there is a materials-rich environment. Materials are set-up in the classroom so that they are easily accessible at a child’s level. This helps facilitate children’s active exploration. Teachers set up the classroom areas purposefully for children to explore and build social relationships, often with well-defined areas for different activities. A child is the happiest when in a cheerful and colorful environment, which is what Parakeets has! The furniture is made up of such a comfortable material and size, the child feels happy to interact with other children and the teachers also. The toys and study material is made up of non-toxic material. At the same time, the child learns how to adopt the discipline. We make sure, when the children return home with all happy and excitement, they look forward for another day in their Parakeets!</p>
